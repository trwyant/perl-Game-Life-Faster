    Move eg/game-life to script/game-life-faster and install it. Thanks
    to Perlancar for the suggestion.

    Add -pause option to script/game-life-faster.  This pauses the given
    number of seconds after each iteration. The value can be fractional
    if Time::HiRes can be loaded. There is also a 'pause' command, so
    the value can be changed interactively.

    Add 'load' command to script/game-life-faster.  This loads a grid
    (or portion thereof) specified as ASCII art.

    Add rt.cpan.org back to bug reporting methods. Long live RT!

    Get prerequisites up to snuff and add xt/author/prereq.t to ensure
    they stay that way.

    Add methods get_active_text_grid(), get_used_text_grid(). Add
    bookkeeping of live cells in each row and column so the latter runs
    in linear time, not quadratic.

    Base grid on hash rather than array. This is faster on a large grid
    because I do not have to autovivify unused cells. Not surprisingly,
    the memory footprint is much smaller.

    Tweak change bookkeeping so that only one pass through the changes
    list is needed, not two.
