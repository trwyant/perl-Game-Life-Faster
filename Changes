    Add methods get_active_text_grid(), get_used_text_grid(). Add
    bookkeeping of live cells in each row and column so the latter runs
    in linear time, not quadratic.

    Base grid on hash rather than array. This is faster on a large grid
    because I do not have to autovivify unused cells. Not surprisingly,
    the memory footprint is much smaller.

    Tweak change bookkeeping so that only one pass through the changes
    list is needed, not two.
